# MScale
This App targets beginner musicians who want to learn to play a string type instrument.
The app will ask a user to provide the desired string instrument (guitar, ukulele, etc.) and it's tune.
The next step is setting the scale in which a user wants to play. 
The App will then display the neck of an instrument and mark all the 
places (string, fret) pressing which will result in a note that is in the desired scale.
